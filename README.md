# Project 3 - YelpApp

YelpApp is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **21** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
   - [X] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [X] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Flip between views animation
- [X] Implement annotation to map view
- [X] Access detail view from map view
- [X] Access Yelp data from current location
- [X] Search Yelp API

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Tips for AutoLayout
2. Better ways to layout view

## Notes

One challenge that I encountered when working on this app was using and learning AutoLayout. The flipping animation between views was also a challenge.
